            <p class="text">As seen above, several community members are dealing with the same violations that you may have received. Understandly, the process 
            of appealing a ticket is intimidating, especially since you have to stand in front a judge and present a well-contructed argument. Though, many community members have
            directly confronted this intimidation and successfully appealed their tickets. Figure 2 showcases the amount of tickets challenged and won by community members. </p>

            <p class="text">Despite the probability of most people not having any background in law, various community members in Ward 14 were able to successfully appeal their tickets. The large
            success rate across the top 5 ticket violations highlights that anyone is capable of appealing their ticket, regardless of background and capability. Instead of paying an unfair ticket that costs approximately a hundred
            dollars, contesting your ticket is the most optimal solution to completely avoid paying it. About 5% of people contest their ticket, and 58% of those cases win. The high success rates indicate that you are completely capable of challenging a traffic violation 
            and winning.</p>

            <p class="text">Anthony is a member of the community who works a job in managing construction projects. Despite Anthony's work load, he ensured his license plates were 
            correctly displayed with an up-to-date plate and city sticker. However, nearing the expiration date of the car's plates, Anthony was unable to go to an Illinois 
            Secretary of State facility to renew his plates due to work creating lack of time to do anything. Even though Anthony went 2 days before his plates expired to renew them, three days later
            he received a ticket for expired plates.</p>
            <p class="text">Anthony instantly thought that this ticket was unfair because he already filled out the necessary paper work to renew his plates and got caught in between the 
            process. Even though Anthony was a little intimidated by the process, he prepared an argument demonstrating the issue was being resolved since he went to renew his plates 5 days 
            before the ticket was issued and 2 days before the expiration date. When Anthony went to his designated court date, the presentation and detail of his argument convinced the judge that he was not liable of the ticket.</p>
            <p class="text">Therefore, Anthony's ability to confront the intimidation of the process by defending himself from an unfair ticket highlights that anyone can go into
            traffic court and contest their ticket. Even though Anthony had no background in law, he was able to construct an argument that helped him successfully appeal his ticket violation.</p>
